 * search a tree is to do a breadth-first search (BFS). In a BFS you start with the root,

 * You continue the search until either you have examined all the nodes or you find the node you are
 *
 * uses additional memory because it is necessary to track the child nodes for all
 * nodes on a given level while searching that level.
