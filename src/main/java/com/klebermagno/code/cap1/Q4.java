     * Palindrome Permutation: 
     * Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­ drome. 
     * A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 
     * A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. 
     * The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
     * 
     *   EXAMPLE
     *   Input: Tact Coa
     *   Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
     * 
     *  Hits:
     *   You do not have to-and should not-generate all permutations. This would be very inefficient.
     *   What characteristics would a string that is a permutation of a palindrome have?
     *   Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to get this down to 0(N) time.
     *   Can you reduce the space usage by using a bit vector?
